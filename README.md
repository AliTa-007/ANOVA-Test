# Statistical Tests and More...
I discovered coding helps me get a firm grip about subjects. The time I spend dwelling on a particular problem strengthens my understanding of the subject. Therefore, in this repository, I will be automating most of the operations we are required to do in STAT101 & 102 Courses.

1- Automate the ANOVA test
I'm pretty sure Chat-GPT can do a similar job. I had fun nevertheless

2- Conducting the Chi-Square test for contingency tables
Integrated some of my OOP knowledge into this one.
